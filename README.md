I ended up adding a dialogue manager and some interactbles in the scene on top of the character movement and animations!

But my project dissapeared from the unity hub after I finished it. I did push it to GitKraken before that, though I still don't understand much about GitHUb and Gitkraken. Is there a way to retrieve it? Thanks for your time!
